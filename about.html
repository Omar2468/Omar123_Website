        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Hello, My name is Omar, and I am currently in Grade 10. I have many interests outside of school. Some of which include playing soccer, playing video games, and swimming.When I grow up, I would love to visit spain as I love spanish food, it tastes amazing! Some of my personal achievements include 400+ volunteer hours, my commitment to school, and my fitness level! I am really interested in astronomical studies, as you can tell by my background!</p>
